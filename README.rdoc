= Amazon S3 output plugin for Fluent event collector

== Overview

*s3* output plugin buffers event logs in local file and upload it to S3 periodically.

This plugin splits files exactly by using the time of event logs (not the time when the logs are received). For example, a log '2011-01-02 message B' is reached, and then another log '2011-01-03 message B' is reached in this order, the former one is stored in "20110102.gz" file, and latter one in "20110103.gz" file.


== Installation

Simply use RubyGems:

    gem install fluent-plugin-s3

== Configuration

    <match pattern>
      type s3

      aws_key_id YOUR_AWS_KEY_ID
      aws_sec_key YOUR_AWS_SECRET/KEY
      s3_bucket YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
      s3_endpoint s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
      s3_object_key_format %{path}%{time_slice}_%{index}.%{file_extension}
      path logs/
      buffer_path /var/log/fluent/s3

      time_slice_format %Y%m%d-%H
      time_slice_wait 10m
      utc
    </match>

[aws_key_id] AWS access key id. This parameter is required when your agent is not running on EC2 instance with an IAM Instance Profile.

[aws_sec_key] AWS secret key. This parameter is required when your agent is not running on EC2 instance with an IAM Instance Profile.

[s3_bucket (required)] S3 bucket name.

[s3_endpoint] s3 endpoint name. Example, Tokyo region is "s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com".

[s3_object_key_format] The format of S3 object keys. You can use several built-in variables:

- %{path}
- %{time_slice}
- %{index}
- %{file_extension}

to decide keys dynamically.

%{path} is exactly the value of *path* configured in the configuration file. E.g., "logs/" in the example configuration above.
%{time_slice} is the time-slice in text that are formatted with *time_slice_format*.
%{index} is the sequential number starts from 0, increments when multiple files are uploaded to S3 in the same time slice.
%{file_extention} is always "gz" for now.

The default format is "%{path}%{time_slice}_%{index}.%{file_extension}".

For instance, using the example configuration above, actual object keys on S3 will be something like:

    "logs/20130111-22_0.gz"
    "logs/20130111-23_0.gz"
    "logs/20130111-23_1.gz"
    "logs/20130112-00_0.gz"

With the configuration:

    s3_object_key_format %{path}/events/ts=%{time_slice}/events_%{index}.%{file_extension}
    path log
    time_slice_format %Y%m%d-%H

You get:

    "log/events/ts=20130111-22/events_0.gz"
    "log/events/ts=20130111-23/events_0.gz"
    "log/events/ts=20130111-23/events_1.gz"
    "log/events/ts=20130112-00/events_0.gz"

The {fluent-mixin-config-placeholders}[https://github.com/tagomoris/fluent-mixin-config-placeholders] mixin is also incorporated, so additional variables such as %{hostname}, %{uuid}, etc. can be used in the s3_object_key_format. This could prove useful in preventing filename conflicts when writing from multiple servers.

    s3_object_key_format %{path}/events/ts=%{time_slice}/events_%{index}-%{hostname}.%{file_extension}

[auto_create_bucket] Create S3 bucket if it does not exists. Default is true.

[path] path prefix of the files on S3. Default is "" (no prefix).

[buffer_path (required)] path prefix of the files to buffer logs.

[time_slice_format] Format of the time used as the file name. Default is '%Y%m%d'. Use '%Y%m%d%H' to split files hourly.

[time_slice_wait] The time to wait old logs. Default is 10 minutes. Specify larger value if old logs may reache.

[utc] Use UTC instead of local time.
